# Bill-Shock Early Warning System

A comprehensive web-based dashboard designed to monitor electricity usage patterns and provide early warnings for potential budget overruns. This project demonstrates the evolution of UI/UX design, transitioning from a functional wireframe to a fully responsive, modern interface.

## Project Overview

The **Electricity Bill Reminder** is designed to help users track their daily power consumption, visualize usage trends, and select energy-saving plans. The project highlights the importance of **User Interface (UI)** and **User Experience (UX)** design in transforming raw data into actionable insights.

## Design Evolution

This repository contains two distinct versions of the application, showcasing the development lifecycle:

### 1. [The Foundation (Version 1)](./test1/index.html)
*   **Directory:** `/test1`
*   **Concept:** A faithful implementation of the initial wireframe.
*   **Focus:** Core functionality, structural layout, and basic data visualization.
*   **Style:** Minimalist and functional.

### 2. [The Evolution (Version 2)](./test2/index.html)
*   **Directory:** `/test2`
*   **Concept:** A complete UI overhaul inspired by modern utility applications (e.g., True iService).
*   **Focus:** Enhanced aesthetics, interactivity, and cross-platform compatibility.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Responsive Design:** Seamlessly adapts between mobile (vertical stack) and desktop (grid/split layout) views.
    *   **Modern Aesthetics:** Utilizes a vibrant color palette, rounded geometry (squircle), and soft shadows.
    *   **Interactive Elements:** Dynamic plan selection flow, hover effects, and animated transitions.
    *   **Data Visualization:** Integrated **Chart.js** for rendering intuitive line and doughnut charts.
